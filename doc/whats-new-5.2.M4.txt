What's new in Nuxeo 5.2.M4
==========================

[STATUS: DRAFT - will be announced on Feb 2]
[TODO IS: add paragraphs for functional items, fix wording, reorganize to fit 
the structure and order I've defined in the summary]

*Cleaner and leaner for developers, extra features for users!*

Summary 
--------

### Functional enhancements

- Content Annotation Service: annotation document content and pictures
  (multi-GB ones), thanks to this in-browser HTML-based annotation technology,
  leveraging W3C Annotea.

- Implementation of *Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0* (WSS) for a
  native integration with MS Office and Windows desktops.

- Virtual Navigation is now bundled by default and allows to browse the
  repository on several metadata axis.

- Improved picture support: picture's metadata extraction, picture libraries,
  in-browser crop/resize.

- Theme Editor: added support for custom themes that can be created
  "through the web" and be stored without modifying the configuration of the
  application. Added a preset manager and a style manager to better organize
  styles and presets. Added a "save changes" function.

- WebWorkspaces: expose workspaces on the web, exposing them as "dedicated
  collaborative mini-sites", including document publishing, blogs and wikis.


### Technical enhancements

- Visible Content Store: new storage engine the repository (but continued
  support for Jackrabbit).

- Improvement of WebEngine, the web framework for Content-Oriented Web Apps,
  now fully-based on JAX-RS and integrated with Eclipse IDE.

- Advanced document conversion service, with improved caching and OpenOffice
  instances management (for office doc conversions).

- Nuxeo Monitoring Services: access and expose monitoring data of components,
  accessible through HTTP and JMX.

- Simplified and faster workflow service, leveraging jBPM properly and more
  integrated with the repository.

- Cleaner, simpler event model (compatible with JMS, but JMS is not required).

- Improved Audit Service, easier to customize and integrated with the new 
  monitoring services.

- The Theme Engine and the Theme Editor now run natively under WebEngine 
  (Jetty, Glassfish) and under JBoss/JSF.

  Access to the theme editor requires Administrator privileges which means that
  themes are protected against unwanted modifications.

  Large effort has been put into simplifying the creation and the management
  of themes through the web, without having to redeploy the application and to 
  restart the server. This allows end-users who have sufficient privileges to 
  create and save their own theme while the application is already deployed.

  Custom style presets, i.e. color, font, background properties, can also be 
  created through the web. Previously they needed to be registered as static 
  configuration files.

  A Style Manager and a Preset Manager have been added to the Theme Editor to
  simplify the management of styles and presets.

  Any color found in a theme which is not declared as a preset can be easily
  converted into a preset.

  A "Save changes" button has been added to the Theme Editor to remind users
  that changes need to be saved.


WebWorkspace
------------

### What is new?

This is the beta release of WebWorkspace that allows easy creation of 
web sites whose content lives in a Nuxeo repository.  This feature is
built on WebEngine and JSF and is visible in all Nuxeo workspaces. By
just clicking a checkbox, you can enable access to the workspace from
the web.

You can define:

- the URL of the website
- the template used for the content of the website
- coming soon: you will be able to define it's theme using Nuxeo's theme editor

Annotation Service
------------------

### What's new?

This is the first public release of the Nuxeo annotation system. There is a new
tab for documents now: the preview tab.  This uses the Preview addons and
the nuxeo Imaging addons to display the content of a file within Nuxeo
itself! Then, if you want, you can add textual annotations and
these are not only stored, but the annotations are kept as Nuxeo relations. 
If the annotations are on images-no matter how large-the location of the
annotation is recorded as well, so other people reviewing the document see
the annotation at the right "place" in the image.

The annotation service is built on the W3C standard Annotea for shared
meta-data.

### More info

See the Nuxeo Book here:
<http://doc.nuxeo.org/5.2/books/nuxeo-book/html/annotation-service.html>

Windows SharePoint Services
----------------------------

### What's new?

We have implemented most parts of the "Windows SharePoint Services" protocol,
related to file services. 

This gives you native and transparent integration with MS-Windows and
MS-Office, since both see Nuxeo EP as a SharePoint server.

### Why is it good?

Users can now load and save documents to Nuxeo as easily as they can with
a SharePoint server.  Also, the enhanced features that work with a SharePoint
server--such as granting a user access to the document--work with Nuxeo and
are visible in the user interface of Office tools like Word in a new side panel. 

Virtual Navigation
------------------
[TODO: Tiry]

### More info

See the Nuxeo Book here:
<http://doc.nuxeo.org/5.2/books/nuxeo-book/html/vnavigation.html>

Picture Support
---------------------
[TODO: Tiry]

Nuxeo Theme
------------

### Theme Engine

The Theme Engine can be used directly with WebEngine.
This allows themes created under Nuxeo EP and running on JBoss to be reused in a 
pure WebEngine environment provided that new views have been defined:

Declared views now require a "template-engine" attribute:

    <view name="breadcrumbs" template-engine="freemarker">
      <format-type>widget</format-type>
      <template>widgets/breadcrumbs.ftl</template>
    </view>

If no "template-engine" attribute is specified, then "jsf-facelets" is assumed
by default. This is meant for backward compatibility with existing Nuxeo EP
applications.

You are invited to update your custom JSF view declarations to remove warnings
at startup. Simply add: template-engine="jsf-facelets" in your theme 
contribution file:

    <view name="my widget" template-engine="jsf-facelets">
      <format-type>widget</format-type>
      <template>widgets/my-widget.xhtml</template>
    </view>

### Theme Editor

The Theme Editor application has been ported to WebEngine which allows it to
run natively in both JSF and Freemarker environments.

Access to the theme editor requires Administrator privileges which means that
themes are protected against unwanted modifications.

Large effort has been put into simplifying the creation and the management
of themes through the web, without having to redeploy the application and to 
restart the server.

Custom themes created in the theme editor are thus stored in the temporary 
folder of the application server in:

  /opt/jboss/server/default/data/NXRuntime/themes/ under JBOSS

and in:

  /opt/nxserver/themes/ under Jetty and Glassfish

This allows end-users who have sufficient privileges to create and save their
own theme while the application is already deployed.

Custom style presets, i.e. color, font, background properties, can also be 
created through the web. Previously they needed to be registered as static 
configuration files.

Custom presets are defined per theme. They are stored in the theme's XML file 
under `<presets>`:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <theme description="" name="my-theme">
      ...
      <presets>
        <preset category="font" name="default">14px Arial</preset>
        <preset category="background"
            name="button">url(/skin/app/img/bg-button.png)</preset>
        <preset category="color" name="blue">#009</preset>
        <preset category="color" name="light gray">#ccc</preset>
      </presets>
      ...
    </theme>

A Style Manager and a Preset Manager have been added to the Theme Editor to
simplify the management of styles and presets.

Any color found in a theme which is not declared as a preset can be easily
converted into a preset.


Visible Content Store
---------------------

### What has changed?

Although the repository API and high level features remain the same, we offer 
a new storage engine. In addition to the Jackrabbit store, we now offer a native 
engine for RDBMS databases: Visible Content Store™. The relational data model is 
based on the XSD schemas; this basically means that the RDB 
model is now fully compliant with the business domain model. We believe it's a 
great technology and will enable a range of new apps and integration mechanisms 
for our customers.

### Why is it better?

The data stored in the RDB is no longer cryptic and opaque, as it is with 
Jackrabbit's mapping. This has a number of benefits for data processing:

- you can see and debug your data in the SQL database,
- you can do simple batch processing for mass import and export,
- you can migrate your schemas easily,
- you can plug any SQL-compliant reporting tool to do reports on top of the 
 Nuxeo repository.

The Visible Content Store™ repository itself is also an important step because it opens 
the way for a lot of low level optimizations:

- denormalization for speed,
- per-database data structures (arrays, uuid types, indexes, full text),
- per-database stored procedures for speedups,
- it opens the way for extending our search model to also support efficient 
  join with Relations and Audit,

Visible Content Store also opens the way for additional high-level features 
like tree-based versioning, mixins, user-defined schemas.

WebEngine
---------

### What has changed?

Nuxeo 5.2M4 includes WebEngine RC2. WebEngine is a new web framework to create
content-oriented web apps. It is now based on JAX-RS (Java API for Restful
Services, aka JSR-311), making it an attractive tool to build RESTful services
and applications on top of the platform.

- Simplified the web module declaration and packaging 
- Full lazy loading of web modules.
- Hot reload of Java classes residing inside WebEngine modules.
- Eclipse plugin to develop webengine modules including: 
- A WebEngine project nature.
- WebEngine server view that allows deploying WebEngine module projects on a 
  remote WebEngine.
- Starting a remote WebEngine in run or debug mode from eclipse. (Eclipse run 
  configurations are used) 
- Transparent java classes reload on the remote WebEngine server as java 
  sources are modified (and saved) in eclipse. 
- Modules can now be "headless" if they have no web GUI.
- Groovy is still supported but is now not turned on default.  Groovy code can
  also be hot-reloaded from the Eclipse UI.

The Eclipse plugin is available as an eclipse update site at 
<http://download.nuxeo.org/nuxeo-ide/updates/snapshots/>. It makes the
development experience a real bliss for content-oriented apps developers!

### Why is it better?

- Allows much tighter, faster development loop for Java developers using
  WebEngine inside eclipse.
- Allows easy creating of RESTful Web applications that integrate with the
  Nuxeo platform. 
- Headless modules can be used to implement REST-based web services that
  do not have a user interfaces. 

Conversion Service
-------------------

### What has changed?

The Transformation Service had some API design issues that we wanted to fix.

This required defining a brand new interface, so we decided to create a new 
service name to avoid any confusion.

### Why is it better?

- API is now simpler: there are only "converters", not transformers and plugins like previously.
- It includes by default a cache system (caching transformation results)
- data input/output is handled by BlobHolder interface, no more 
 TransformDocument or plain Blob
- ConversionAPI now provides an API to know if converter is available, 
 this is useful when the converter depends on an external program that must 
 be installed on the server (like OpenOffice server)

### About compatibility

Transformer API is now deprecated and the old transform implementations and 
plugins have been removed from default distribution.

A tranformer-compat bundle is provided for compatibility.

Transformers API is still available, but the implementation now wraps calls to 
the ConversionService.

This means you can use the new Converters from the old Transformation service 
API.

All default included Transformers have been migrated to Converters with the 
same name.

Code that was using transformers should still work in 5.2.

If you have contributed Transformers, they will be available as Converters  
via the compatibility API, but you may have to change the Required-Bundle in the 
MANIFEST.MF of your bundle.

### More info

See the Nuxeo Book here:
<http://doc.nuxeo.org/5.2/books/nuxeo-book/html/nuxeo-conversion.html>

Monitoring Service
------------------

### What's new?

Nuxeo Runtime now includes a module to expose Nuxeo services and extension
points via JMX. Each service can also expose the data is wants easily thanks
to this new feature. An HTTP interface to browse exposed services and data is
also providing to ensure maximum compatibility and integration capabilities
with your monitoring systems.

### Why is it good?

You can now use standard tools like the Java Management Console to monitor and
administrate all services of Nuxeo's platform.

### More info

See the Nuxeo Book here:
<http://doc.nuxeo.org/5.2/books/nuxeo-book/html/nuxeo-management.html>

Workflows
---------

### What has changed?

The Workflow service has been completely re-coded from scratch. It still uses
jBPM, but the WFMC API on top of it has been removed.

### Why is it better?

Defining workflows is now much easier: you only have to know jBPM, there is
no longer a need to go through the WFMC mapping. The full power of the jBPM
engine at your hands... ;-)

This also means that defining processes in Nuxeo is now straightforward for a
jBPM-skilled developer, the JBPL definition holds more logic and you can use a
jBPM visual editor to set up the process.

Moreover, the new service delivers higher performances on the UI side.

Next step: extend the JPDL expression language to expose more generic
Nuxeo primitives, improving JBPL integration with the platform.

### About compatibility

Existing workflows have been rewritten using the new service and are available
in the UI.

But, there is no transparent upgrade (sorry for that), but it is still possible
to deploy the old workflow stack on 5.2M4 to use existing processes without
rewriting them.


Event Service
-------------

### What has changed?

We now provides a new API and extension point system to:

- fire events or event bundles
- register event listeners

Previously, we had to different models: CoreEvents + CoreListeners / 
JMSEvents + Message Driven Beans. Starting with 5.2-M4, the model is now 
completely streamlined. JMS is still used when needed, but it's now an 
implementation detail of the platform, and it's transparent for the listeners.

### Why is it better?

The API for sending an event is now far simpler, as well as unified.

Writing an EventListener is also simpler:

- no need to write a Message Driven Bean (MDB)
- no need to handle Authentication/Repository initialization
- there are only 2 interfaces: EventListener / PostCommitEventListener
- you can use a simple script!

EventListeners can now be:

- synchronous: on the fly processing within the same transaction
- postcommit synchronous: just after the commit in a new separated transaction
- postcommit asynchronous

The new eventListener system also manages these transactions for you.

One of the key benefit of this simplification, is that JMS is no longer a 
required dependency: you can have asynchronous listeners without JMS.

Thus:

- we can embed more services in a lightweight container (jetty, tomcat, gf3 prelude)
- you can now easily unit test your EventListeners without requiring 
 to setup a JMS service

### About compatibility

We provide a nuxeo-core-event-compat package that re-enables old event system:

- run transparently old CoreListeners
- forward to the old JMS Topic
- triggers old MDBs

If you need the old API for sending events/messages, just deploy the
old nuxeo-platform-event-* packages.

Audit Service
-------------

### What has changed?

Audit service is now far more easier to configure to get customized logs
(infos to log on events), no need to contribute a Entity class; just
configure your log format (XML) and we do the rest!

Audit service is now based on the EventService allowing it run in unit tests
and inside lightweigtht containers (see below).

The Audit service is now integrated into the Nuxeo Management extensions, so you 
can get informations from Audit via JMX.

We also did some API cleanup.

### Why is it better?

Configuring Audit log is now easy: you can now leverage this to build a
custom application level log to monitor usage of the platform and build
business reports on top of it.

### About compatibility

If you haven't customized your AuditLog format, migration is transparent (the
system migrate the tables). If you have, you need to configure your audit log
format in the new service first.

### More info

See the Nuxeo Book here:
<http://doc.nuxeo.org/5.2/books/nuxeo-book/html/audit-service.html>

Indexing & Search
-----------------

### What has changed?

SearchService has been deprecated -> M4 does not depend on Compass/Lucene for indexing and search.

Complete indexing/query support (including full text) is now provide directly 
by the repository (on both VisibleSQL and JCR backends).

### Why is it better?

- This should fix the problems we have seen with Compass/Lucene locks 
- Complete indexing/query support even for embedded packagings (such as Jetty)

###Compatibility

Full compatibility is providing, thanks to NXQL and a pass through in the previous SearchService (which actually requests the repository).


Nuxeo Directory UI
-----------------

### What has changed?

Default Users/Groups management screens now use the Layout Service for forms
definition and rendering. 
New JSF component to handle a "suggestion box" on top of directories.

### Why is it better?

You can now customize easily Users/Groups screens.

You can easily integrate users/groups or any directory search in your layouts 
or XHTML pages.

Misc additions
--------------


### Command-line Service

Allows you to configure external command line tools that you want to use from 
within Nuxeo.

The service handles:

- configuration of the command lines (with OS specific options if needed)
- mapping of command I/O
- API to test command availability
- API to get installation message

### OOo server daemon

OpenOffice.org server can now be managed by a Daemon hosted in Nuxeo.

The daemon provides:

- automatic OOo installation discovery when possible
- automatic OOo start: off / on Nuxeo startup / on first usage
- OOo instance pooling


Addons that are now part of the default distribution
----------------------------------------------------

- Preview service
- Tiling service
- Annotation service
- Virtual Navigation
- PictureBook and imaging services
