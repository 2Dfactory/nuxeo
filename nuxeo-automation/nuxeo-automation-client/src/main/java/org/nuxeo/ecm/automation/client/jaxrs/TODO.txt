REQUIRED:
1. implement multipart-form-encoded
2. Web Services
3. operation security
4. review client session (do we need to authenticate when doing get /automation ?)
5. cleanup -> move classes (e.g. OperationDocumentation) share classes between client/server; split projects in client/server
6. improve java client API

OPTIONAL:
1. Implement GWT client
2. expose doc types?


classes that are duplicated between server,core and client:
OperationDocumentation
JSONExporter - removed 2 methods that are dep. on automation-core
InputStreamDataSource - is used by the server
operation IDs are hardcoded

===
shoukd we return all schemas when returning docs if the right header is specified?
remove types in param fron extension ? we can use string adapters for this ..
setInput for void operations is normal? (in fact setInput is for the context)
canot change file name on a fileblob
attach blob doesnt support multiple blobs - see blobs test in rest server
