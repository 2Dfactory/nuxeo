/**
 * Signifies that annotated API is still in early stage and subject to incompatible changes, or even removal, in a
 * future release. The presence of this annotation implies nothing about the code quality or performance, only the fact
 * that the API is not yet "frozen".
 * <p>
 * It is generally safe to depend on Experimental APIs, at the prospective cost of some extra work during upgrades. The
 * API <code>@Since</code> annotation gives a preview on how much mature it is and the chances for the
 * <code>@Experimental</code> annotation being soon removed.
