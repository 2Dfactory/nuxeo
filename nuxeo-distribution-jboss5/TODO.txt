1. No more OSGi-INF dir. at the nuxeo.ear root
Templates are residing now in META-INF/templates
and the preprocessing descriptor is in META-INF/nuxeo-preprocessor.xml

2. New files should be added in nuxeo.ear/META-INF:
- nuxeo-deployers-jboss-beans.xml
to define the nuxeo launcher deployer
- nuxeo-structure.xml
contain nuxeo.ear structure definition (used by custom Nuxeo JBoss5 structure deployer)
- jboss-scanning.xml
contains filter to avoid useless scanning (improve start time)
- nuxeo-preprocessor.xml
contains preprocessing configuration
- templates/
contains preprocessing templates
- unified-nuxeo-ds.xml

3. default-repository-ds.xml should be placed in datasources/
no other files should placed there.
TODO: I may switch the location of unifid-nuxeo-ds.xml and the one of
default-repository-ds.xml (or may be change the location of unified ds and put it in config)

4. A single file in JBoss deploy/ -> nuxeo-ds.xml

Target profiles:
- DEFAULT : Exploded nuxeo.ear with preprocessing support and with deployer externalized in deployers JBoss directory.
The nuxeo-jboss-deployer.jar will be put in deployers/ folder.
This is the default profile - and should be used in development too.

For this profile we need to deploy nuxeo-common and nuxeo-runtime-deployment in jboss lib (since the preprocessor depends on)

- PACKED: nuxeo.ear already preprocessed
This is requiring all nuxeo bundles that are not EAR modules (etc. listed in application.xml) in lib directory.
In this case nuxeo-jboss-deployer.jar can be put directly in nuxeo.ear/lib
This deployment doesn't requires external files apart nuxeo-ds.xml.
This deployment can work either with a packed or unpacked nuxeo.ear

Depending on the profile you may need different cnfiguration files:

PACKED:
nuxeo-structure-zip.xml -> rename it to nuxeo-structure.xml
